=== Testing Procedure

Network Tests:

. Build new network according to specified topology
. Create addresses
. Import existing (mainnet) state
. Apply network conditions (if applicable)
. Send transactions from specified number of nodes
. Log time transaction sent from Tx node
. Log transaction and block data
. Timeout 10 seconds.
. Make sure all data is saved to DB in proper format.
. Backup data locally
. Tear down network
. Parse data after each test

Sync Time Test:

. Build new network according to specified topology
. Create addresses
. Import existing (mainnet) state
. Apply network conditions (if applicable)
. Send transactions from specified number of nodes
. Add an additional node to the network
. Measure the time it takes for the newly added node to sync with the built out network

=== Test Metrics

* The baseline test will be run using the latest version of geth with it's original call data size set to 32KB
* Each test series focuses on a specific variable
* Each test case within a test series contains a range of values for the variable of focus within that series
* Each test case will be run a total of 3 times
* Each test will be run until 500 blocks are collected
* Final data points will also be presented as an average of these three trials
* Metrics to be collected on network performance tests:
 ** Tx ID
 ** Tx size
 ** Sender address
 ** Receiving address
 ** Send time
 ** Rcv time
 ** Block number
 ** Block hash
 ** Block Info
 ** Block size
 ** Mempool size
 ** Block transmission time (Difference of send and receive time)
 ** Block header validation time
 ** Block processing time
 ** Total delay
 ** Uncle Rate
